# Twitter Trending Classifier â€” by Dodevca

A lightweight tool to classify Twitter/X posts into noise, neutral, and relevant categories using a combination of rule-based logic and Logistic Regression model.

---

## About This Project
This project automates the classification of trending Twitter/X posts to filter out irrelevant content. It combines a simple rule-based system with a Logistic Regression model to improve filtering accuracy. The application is built with Flask and integrates Google Colab notebooks for model training and experimentation.
